# Monnit
Monnit is a system resources monitoring system that tracks your Windows system's performance metrics such as CPU usage, RAM usage, storage, and networking details. It does this by installing an agent on your Windows machine that runs a PHP script to collect data via command line. The agent then sends this data to a cloud database where it is securely stored for future analysis.

The Monnit website provides a user-friendly interface for users to view the collected data. Users can visualize their system's data in various forms such as bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs. This makes it easy to quickly understand how your system is performing over time and identify potential issues before they become critical.

Monnit is designed for anyone who wants to keep track of their system's performance and ensure that it is running optimally. Whether you're a system administrator responsible for maintaining dozens of machines, or a casual user who wants to monitor their personal computer, Monnit provides a powerful set of tools to help you achieve your goals.

One of the unique features of Monnit is its ability to collect and present data in a variety of formats. This makes it easy to see how your system's performance changes over time and identify trends that might not be apparent otherwise. Additionally, Monnit's cloud-based architecture means that you can access your system's data from anywhere, at any time, making it a flexible and convenient solution for modern computing environments.
